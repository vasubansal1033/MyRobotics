    "Assignment is written in <i>Python</i> and implemented on <i>Jupyter Notebook</i> <br>\n",
    "<b>Note</b> - Python is used because Object oriented programming was easier to do and also because there is a library called Pygame which was used. It offered various functionalities like drawing Obstacles, detecting collisions plotting lines easily and also the implementation was a lot faster than in MatLab"
